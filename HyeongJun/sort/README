<Project 1 : Sorting>

There are several sorting algorithms such as insertion, merge, counting, quick and the sample text file in src directory

sample text file is composed of the unsorted numbers, and they have a blank between numbers
,thus if you want to use other sample text file, you must make text file that include a blank between numbers


Compile : make
Execute : bin/sorting_exe <Q,M,I,C> <sample.txt>
	Q = quick sort, M = merge sort, I = insertion sort, C = counting sort
	e.g>./sorting_exe Q sample.txt
