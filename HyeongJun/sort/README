<Project 1 : Sorting>

There are several sorting algorithms such as insertion, merge, counting, quick and the sample text file

sample text file is composed of the unsorted numbers, and they have a blank between numbers
,thus if you want to use other sample text file, you must make text file that include a blank between numbers

Compile : gcc -g <c file> -o <generator name that you want>
         ex> gcc -g quick_sort.c -o test_quick
Execute : ./<generator name> <text file name>
         ex>./test_quick sample.txt
