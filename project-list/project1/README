<Project 1 : Sorting>

This project is to implement various kind of sorting algorithms
and see the different time complexity among those algorithms. 

Implement insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort and count sort
and check the execution time for each sorting program.

- Test generator program is provided in this directory
Program "test_generator" generates the test files.
Test files would have random numbers unordered.
You can generates test files by the size you want to generate.

Compile : make
Execute : ./test_generator <filename> <size>
It's your choice to name <filename>, but you should include .txt.
<size> is the amount of distinct numbers you want to generate.
(You should input size less than maximum int coverage..)

(Example : ./test_generator input.txt 100000)
